raspimobot
==========

This software project was done for the course Intelligent Embedded System (id 582711) at the CS Department of the University of Helsinki. The course was held during Spring term 2014, third period.

raspimobot is a Raspberry Pi robot that uses camera module and L293D motor control chip to control a single motor. The robot detects movement with the camera and turns the camera (with the motor) towards the movement position. It also supports the use of .wav audio files to greet the person that causes the movement.
